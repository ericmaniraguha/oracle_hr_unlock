# **Oracle HR Schema & Employee Managament System PDB (ems_pdb) Setup Guide**

This guide walks you through **creating a Pluggable Database (PDB) in Oracle 23c Free** on Windows, and **setting up the sample HR schema**. Perfect for students or anyone learning PL/SQL and Oracle database management.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

* Oracle 23c Free / AI Edition installed on Windows.
* Access to **SQL*Plus as SYSDBA**.
* Target folder for the new PDB exists, e.g.:

```
C:\APP\ERICM\PRODUCT\26AI\ORADATA\FREE\ems_pdb\
```

*Recommended:* Oracle SQL Developer for running scripts.

---

## **2. Connect as SYSDBA**

Open **SQL*Plus** and connect:

```sql
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

*You should see a message confirming the connection.*

---

## **3. Check existing PDBs**

```sql
SHOW PDBS;
SHOW CON_NAME;
```

*Notes:*

* `CDB$ROOT` – the root container
* `PDB$SEED` – seed template used to create new PDBs

---

## **4. Verify SYSTEM tablespace location**

```sql
SELECT file_name FROM dba_data_files WHERE tablespace_name='SYSTEM';
```

*This ensures you know where the PDB files will be created.*

---

## **5. Create the Pluggable Database**

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE ems_pdb
   ADMIN USER admin IDENTIFIED BY admi
   FILE_NAME_CONVERT = (
       'C:\APP\ERICM\PRODUCT\26AI\ORADATA\FREE\',
       'C:\APP\ERICM\PRODUCT\26AI\ORADATA\FREE\ems_pdb\'
   );
```

*What this does:*

* Creates a new PDB called `EMS_PDB`.
* Creates an admin user `admin`.
* Copies seed database files to your target folder.

---

## **6. Open and Save PDB State**

```sql
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ems_pdb OPEN;
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ems_pdb SAVE STATE;
```

*This makes sure the PDB opens automatically on startup.*

---

## **7. Switch session to EMS_PDB**

```sql
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = ems_pdb;
SHOW CON_NAME;
```

*Now your session is inside the new PDB.*

---

## **8. Create / Alter Admin User**

```sql
ALTER USER admin IDENTIFIED BY admin;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO admin;
```

*Grants necessary privileges to manage tables, sequences, and logins.*

---

## **9. Verify PDBs**

```sql
SHOW PDBS;
SELECT name FROM v$pdbs;
```

*Confirm that `EMS_PDB` is listed and ready.*

---

## **10. Download and Prepare HR Schema Scripts**

1. Clone the repository **or** download SQL files manually.
2. Files to run:

| Script | Purpose                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 01     | Switch to PDB & create HR user |
| 02     | Create tables                  |
| 03     | Populate tables                |
| 04     | Create indexes & comments      |

---

## **11. Run HR Schema Scripts**

1. Connect as **HR user**.
2. Run scripts in order: **01 → 02 → 03 → 04**.
3. Verify tables and data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM departments;
```

🎉 **The HR schema is now fully set up!**

---

## **Summary Checklist**

1. [x] Connected to `CDB$ROOT` as SYSDBA
2. [x] Created PDB `EMS_PDB` and admin user
3. [x] Opened and saved PDB state
4. [x] Switched session to `EMS_PDB`
5. [x] Prepared HR schema scripts
6. [x] Created HR user, tables, and populated sample data

---
*You now have a working PDB with the HR schema for PL/SQL practice or learning.*
